Abstract Factory Pattern says that just define an interface or abstract class for creating families
of related (or dependent) objects but without specifying their concrete sub-classes.
That means Abstract Factory lets a class returns a factory of classes. So,
this is the reason that Abstract Factory Pattern is one level higher than the Factory Pattern.

An Abstract Factory Pattern is also known as Kit.

Advantage of Abstract Factory Pattern
    Abstract Factory Pattern isolates the client code from concrete (implementation) classes.
    It eases the exchanging of object families.
    It promotes consistency among objects.
